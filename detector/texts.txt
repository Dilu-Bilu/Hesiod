On the eve of passing a new constitution to the great Russian Empire, Tsar Alexander II was brutally assassinated by members of the Narodnaya volya. This thrust his second son, Alexander III into Tsardom. Under the rule of Alex III, Russia underwent a more repressive and revolutionary period compared to Alex II’s liberal and western rule. This can be evidenced through economic reforms, education reforms, and reforms to the peasantry. Under Alex III, Russia was able to grow much more economically than under the rule of Alex II. This can be seen primarily with Alex III’s wanting to build a self-sufficient economy. In 1891, foreign import taxes were raised to 33%, discouraging the consumption of foreign goods. In addition to that, Finance Minister from 1887-1892, Ivan Vyshnegradsky once said that, “We must go hungry, but export”. This simply re-inforced how Alex III viewed the Russian economy, it must sustain itself. The stance was greatly impactful as in 1891, government income rose by 50% and revenue by 18% as a result of said reactionary economic policies and goals. This was a highlight of Alex III’s economic reforms. This proved that his self-sufficient economic management would work, although at the cost of human lives as can be seen in the 1891-92 Volga famine. On the other hand, Alex II’s economic reforms were impactful, but much less in magnitude than his successor. Alex II’s great economic achievement was the emancipation of the serfs in March of 1861. This set the basis and foundation of future industrialization and modernization of the Russian economy. Furthermore, Alex II saw the need of improved railway infrastructure in order to be able to transport goods efficiently, so 1660km of railway was built under Alex II’s reign between 1871-1875. The economic reforms made by both Tsars were widely considered positive. However, Alex III’s conservative and self-sufficient economic policies with Finance Minister Vyshnegradsky were much more impactful in comparison with Alex II’s economic reforms. With reference to education, both Tsars had huge contributions on Russia’s academic landscape although many historians argue that Alex II did better in this aspect than his successor. In 1863, the College Statue was passed by Alex II, giving universities more autonomy, as well as passing the Education Edict which made a primary education compulsory. 21 years later in 1884, Alex III took back College autonomy and raised tuition fees in 1887. This is a polarizing example of how Alex II’s liberal stance and acceptance of western ideals differs from Alex III’s conservative and reactionary ideals. All in all, a smarter population on average should be better for industrial and economic growth. However, it is very easy to see why Alex III instituted the reforms he did. After seeing his father die at the hands of the terrorist group, the Narodnaya Volya, it is reasonable from Alex III’s perspective to take a step away from westernizing and giving the people more new revolutionary literature in order to maintain his rule, and life. This makes Alex III’s reactionary policies against education much more justifiable when compared to his father’s relaxation on education. In regards to the peasantry, Alex II’s general relaxation on serfdom greatly contrasts with the views of his son. Alex II’s great claim to fame was the Emancipation Statute in March of 1861. Although this new statute was not perfect by any means, it was still viewed as a step in the right direction for Russia to undergo industrialization like other great European powers like England and France. On the contrary, yes Alexander III did some good for the peasants such as instituting the Peasants’ Land Bank in 1886 which lowered redemption payment interest to 4% and encouraged east-ward settlement, but it was Alex III’s other reforms to the peasantry which made him less of a reformist than his father. A law passed in May of 1889 increased the power of the bolshak in their
