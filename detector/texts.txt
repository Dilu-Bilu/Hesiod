Each AOK needs to have both a claim and a counter claim that directly addresses the Prescribed Title. AOK Discipline = It is an area of study within an AOK. If Natural Science is the AOK, then Chemistry, Biology, Nuclear Physics and so forth are the disciplines. If the AOK is Religion, then Christianity, Islam, Monotheism, Polytheism are possible disciplines.TOK Concepts = Ideas, theories, methods both within and across AOK that have been developed, and supported over time. Related to how the AOK structures and builds knowledge. If it is explored before the RLS is introduced, it tends to produce insightful writing (and scores higher.)RLS = The real life situations. Each claim/counter claim needs a specific RLS. However, lower scoring essays spend far too much time describing the RLS. This essay planner pushes you to put your RLS at the end of your paragraph, after you have already done analysis. This keeps your essay from being descriptive (and scoring lower.)Note: Exploring the TOK Concepts of the AOK discipline into which your RLS will fall before you mention any details of the RLS will provide shape to your paragraph and let you explore coherent ideas with no danger of being descriptive.TOK Concepts: These words all relate to how knowledge is generated, classified and verified. This is not a comprehensive list. Use the empty boxes to add any addition TOK concepts you have covered in your TOK class.
