Throughout this excerpt, Bourdain repeatedly mentions highly descriptive adjectives such as “horror,” hesitation, and defiance. The syntax of these words portray how although everyone around Bourdain was terrified with the idea of consuming the raw oyster, Bourdain was much more courageous in his actions. He then follows up with the detailed story in which he describes how and what he was eating. Bourdain explains the shellfish as a, “single slit-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive.” These words make the oyster seem exceptional and otherworldly. When Bourdain consumes the oyster, he mentions how everything had changed, and further used a period to emphasize how absolutely everything has changed in his life. The change that he has just experienced is highlighted much more thoroughly through the repetition in the passage. He exclaims how this moment did not compare to any of his other firsts, “first pussy, first joint, first day in high school, first published book or any other thing.” By repeating his firsts, he makes it sound that this experience he has undergone was incomparable to anything else he had felt in his life. This was such a pivotal moment in his life, that he really wanted to put an emphasis on it to highlight the significance of what he just went through. This journey he had just gone through was very important and he had become a new person by undergoing this experience. In his words, He attained glory. Despite the journey being a pivotal moment of his life, he changed in a way that has made him a brand new person. This new version of Bourdain is power hungry and thrill seeking. He is transformed into a person who’s always left wanting more. The food not only meant a new found sense of being to Bourdain, but also a sense of power. A sense of strength. The italicization of “power,” not to mention the short structure of the sentence, emphasized that to Bourdain, Food really is power.
